            <p>A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like <span style="color: #0EA5E9;">flex, pt-4, text-center</span> and<br> <span style="color: #0EA5E9;">rotate-90</span> that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.</p>

        <h1>“Best practices” don’t actually work.</h1>
        <p>I’ve written a <span style="color: #0EA5E9; cursor: pointer;">few thousand words</span> on why traditional “semantic class names” are the reason CSS is hard to maintain, but the truth is you’re never going to believe me until you actually try it. If you can suppress the urge to retch long enough to give it a chance, I really think you’ll wonder how you ever worked with CSS any other way.</p>

    <section class="two">
        <p><b>Constraint-based</b></p>
        <h1>An API for your design system.</h1>
        <p>Utility classes help you work within the constraints of a system instead of littering your stylesheets with arbitrary values. They make it easy to be consistent with color choices, spacing, typography, shadows, and everything else that makes up a well-engineered design system.</p>
